# General 
- DO NOT OPTIMIZED FOR A SMALLER NUMBER OF LINES OF CODE. NEWLINES ARE CHEAP, BRAIN TIME IS EXPENSIVE.
- Aggregations should be executed as early as possible before joining to another table.


# Logistics
- Indents should be four spaces
- Lines of SQL should be no longer than 80 characters
- Field names and function names should all be lowercase
- Orderding and grouping by a number is preferred. Note that if you are grouping by more than a few columns, it may be worth revisiting your model design.




# Field Naming and Reference Conventions


# CTEs
```
with

events as (

    ...

),

-- CTE comments go here
filtered_events as (

    ...

)

select * from filtered_events

```


# JOINs
- Avoid table aliases in join conditions (expecially initialisms) - it's harder to understand what the table called "c" is compared to "customers".
- If joining two or more tables, always prefix your column names with the table alias. If only selecting from one table, prefixes are not needed.
- Be explicit about your join (i.e. write `inner join` instead of `join`).
